#Rules
Each player has two pigs. Player may choose to roll the pigs, or pass.

Rolling the pigs allows the player to earn points or risk losing points for that turn. Player can keep rolling until pigging out or choosing to pass.
	Dot + Dot = Pig Out (Lose points for turn and pass the pigs)
	No Dot + No Dot = Pig Out (Lose points for turn and pass the pigs)
	Dot + No Dot = 1 point
	Trotter - 5 points
	Razorback - 5 points
	Snouter - 10 points
	Leaning Jowler - 15 points
	(Rolling two of the same result doubles the value of the roll. E.g. 2 razorbacks = (5 + 5) * 2 = 20 points)

When a player reaches 100 points or more and passes the pigs, the game enters the final round. All players have a chance to roll the pigs and earn a result greater than the player that initiated the final round.
The player with the most points at the end of the final round wins the game.
