Rolling the pigs allows the player to earn points or risk losing points for that turn. Player can keep rolling until pigging out or choosing to pass.<br>
	Dot + Dot = Pig Out (Lose points for turn and pass the pigs)<br>
	No Dot + No Dot = Pig Out (Lose points for turn and pass the pigs)<br>
	Dot + No Dot = 1 point<br>
	Trotter - 5 points<br>
	Razorback - 5 points<br>
	Snouter - 10 points<br>
	Leaning Jowler - 15 points<br>
	(Rolling two of the same result doubles the value of the roll. E.g. 2 razorbacks = (5 + 5) * 2 = 20 points)<br>
